========================
Django Frontend Template
========================

Django Frontend Template is a basic Django template skeleton built on `HTML5 Boilerplate <https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate>`_.

With the convenience of a light-weight installable Django application, create custom templates built on top of one of the most well-known, widespread templates (HTML5 Boilerplate.)

There are no static files included. If you want a heavier-weight application built on HTML5 Boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap then checkout `django-frontend-skeleton <https://github.com/jonfaustman/django-frontend-skeleton>`_. If you want to include often used static files then check out `django-frontend-static https://github.com/jonfaustman/django-frontend-skeleton`_.
